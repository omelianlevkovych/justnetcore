The wwwroot folder is special, it is the only folder in your app that browser are allowed to directly access when browsing your web app.

The most important file in default project is SimpleApp.csproj, as it describes how to build your project (msbuild).

## the .csproj file: defining your dependencies
It is the project file for any .NET app. 
It contains the details required for the .NET tooling to build your project. 
It defines the type of project being built (webapp, console, library), which platform the project targets (.NET Core 3.1, .NET 5.0, so on) and which NuGet packages the project depends on.

In ASP.NET Core the .csproj file has been modified (improved) to make it easier to read and edit. These changes include:
* no GUIDs - Previously, GUIDs were used for many things, but now they are rarely used in project file.
* Implicit files include - Previously, every file in the project has to be listed in the .csproj file for it to be included in the build. Now, files are automatically compiled.
* No paths to NuGet package .dll files - Previosly, you had to include the path to the .dll files contained in NuGet packages in the .csproj, as well as listing the dependencies in a package.config file. Now you can reference the NuGet package directly in your .csproj, and you do not need to specify the path on disk.
